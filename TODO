vt emulation
------------

* implement BCE right
* color definition in CSI
	* implement CSI parsing
* wide-character support in conjunction with fallback xft code 
* mouse selection support

code & interface
----------------

* clean and complete terminfo entry
* add fallback fonts for the restricted xft code
* add a simple way to do multiplexing

bugs
----

* fix shift up/down (shift selection in emacs)
* fix selection paste for xatom STRING
* fix umlaut handling in settitle
* fix rows and column definition in fixed geometry
* fix -e handling
* remove DEC test sequence when appropriate
* reverse cursor when drawin light on light background
	* text should be readable
* When some application outputting long text is run in the shell init scripts,
  then this text might be stripped to the standard 80x25 due to st running the
  virtual terminal at first priority. Maybe the vt initialisation could be
  moved somewhere after knowing the right window size.
