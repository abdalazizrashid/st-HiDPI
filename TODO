vt emulation
------------

* wide-character support in conjunction with fallback xft code 
* double-height support

code & interface
----------------

* clean and complete terminfo entry
* add a simple way to do multiplexing

drawing
-------
* add diacritics support to xdraws()
* add kerning configuration
* make the font cache simpler
* add hard width handling
	* xft is reporting wrong width and height for characters

bugs
----

* fix shift up/down (shift selection in emacs)
* fix selection paste for xatom STRING
* fix rows and column definition in fixed geometry
* fix -e handling
* remove DEC test sequence when appropriate
* When some application outputting long text is run in the shell init scripts,
  then this text might be stripped to the standard 80x25 due to st running the
  virtual terminal at first priority. Maybe the vt initialisation could be
  moved somewhere after knowing the right window size.

misc
----

    $ grep -nE 'XXX|TODO' st.c
